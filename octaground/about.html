            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>Project Octaground is both a revisit of the old projects that got nowhere and an excuse for me to put my whining somewhere and have something to put my love and suffering in.</p>
            <p>It's obviously very personal but aside from angsty stuff I used (and plan to continue to use) this project to explore things that fascinate me and turn them into something interesting. While the demo isn't so special in that regard and I apparently enjoyed writing about life being suffering more than actually making something valuable, I still have game mechanics to be made and I cherish the opportunity to put them somewhere.</p>
            <p>It's obviously a shame that my "thing" I write vast dithyrambs about is actually a minecraft bedrock map, very buggy and unplayable. Well, I started this project when learning game engine was to put it mildly not my priority and I just needed a medium to speak through. And this project couldn't make sense outside of the context of minecraft anyway. It's not an excuse of course, but still.</p>
            <p>I probably should apologize for making this. I don't want to be the boy who cried wolves so I think I have to state it that as of writing this I'm fine, and though my stances haven't really changed, I'm sure whoever reads this boldly faces more struggles in their life and deserves to be heard way more than me. So I hope the meta-horror part hasn't worked and you're not so upset by my derangedness.</p>
            <p>Anyways, thanks for reading through my rambling and I hope you'll have a wonderful week!!</p>
